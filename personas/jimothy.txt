#Intro1 (pick one line from each Intro section at random)
Good morning, I think. Is it morning?
Hey there. Uh, is this the lost and found?
Please help me!

#Intro2
I lost my <object> somewhere around here, you haven't taken it in have you?
I had my <object> with me just a few days ago so it must be around here somewhere.
Could you look around and see if someone has handed in my <object>?

#Intro3
I really hope you have it back there, I'm freaking out right now.
Please tell me someone has handed it in!
I've got a train leaving fairly soon and I don't want to leave it behind.

#OutroPositive1
Heck yeah, that's the one! My <object>!
Oh heck yes! I thought I'd never see my <object> again!
There it is! I'd never mistake it, that's my <object>.

#OutroPositive2
Thank you so much for your help, you're a star!
You don't know how much this means to me. Have a great day!
I really appreciate this! Thank you again!

#OutroNegative1
This... isn't mine? Has there been a mix-up?
I mean, that literally has someone's name on it, and it's not mine.
Uh, no. I never want to own one of these. 

#OutroNegative2
Keep your damn <object>. I've gotta go look elsewhere.
I can't believe you've done this.
Oh, and you can shove your <object>. 

#OutroNoItem1
You've got to be kidding me. I have no idea where else to look.
It's definitely not back there? Not behind that mysterious curtain?
Aww, dang it. I've probably lost my <object> for good.

#OutroNoItem2
Thanks for looking though, I do appreciate it.
Thanks for your help, and sorry for taking up your time.
Thank you for looking.

#Weight
Well, I'm fairly confident it's <weight>. I can't say I've weighed it though. 
#Size
Compared to what? Well, if I had to give an answer, I'd probably go with <size>.
#ColourPositive
My one is <colour_1>, that's for sure. They're <colour_2> that colour, though.
#ColourNegative
I wouldn't say it has a colour, to be honest.
#FlammablePositive
Yes, it's flammable. I'm a bit worried why you'd ask me that, though?
#FlammableNegative
No, I don't think it's flammable. Don't you dare test it.
#LivingPositive
Well, yeah, it's a living thing. Are you new to this?
#LivingNegative
Of course it's not living. Don't be silly. 
#EdgesPositive
It's got some edges to it, sure. Here and there. Probably.
#EdgesNegative
What? No, I wouldn't say it had edges. Is... this helping?
#DensityPositive
It's a fairly dense object sure, but if you put it near water I'll jump over this countertop.
#DensityNegative
No, it's not particularly dense. This... is the lost and found, right?
#Feel
It's pretty <feel>, sure. You've put me on the spot a bit.
#EdiblePositive
Oh, you could definitely eat it. Whether you'd want to, well, that's up to you.
#EdibleNegative
I, uh, wouldn't recommend eating it. I'm not sure you even could, honestly. 
#Value
It's a pretty <value> item, really. Don't go getting any ideas though.
#Temperature
It's <temperature>, usually. You... haven't done something weird to it, have you?
#RecyclablePositive
Yes, it's recyclable. I'd prefer you give it back to me rather than recycle it, though.
#RecyclableNegative
No, it's not recyclable. But that shouldn't matter? Because you're giving it back to me? Please?
#Mouthfeel
Mouthfeel? I, uh, don't even know how to answer that. <mouthfeel>? <mouthfeel> mouthfeel, I think?
#BlendPositive
If you had one of those fancy blenders, it'd probably blend. Please don't try.
#BlendNegative
I'd have to say it's fairly blendproof, but I can't say I've tried and I'm happy keeping it that way.
#Shape
It's pretty <shape>-shaped. Which, uh, seems fairly normal.
#CustomsPositive
Oh yeah, this would definitely get taken away by customs. I didn't smuggle this here, though. Honest.
#CustomsNegative
No, I don't think customs would care about it one way or the other. You're not saying they've taken it, are you?
#MagneticPositive
Yeah, I suppose it'd be magnetic. Surely you have a better way of finding my item, though?
#MagneticNegative
No, it's not magnetic. That'd be pretty weird, considering.
