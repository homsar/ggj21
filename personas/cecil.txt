#Intro1 (pick one line from each Intro section at random)
Pleased to meet you.
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

#Intro2
One appears to have misplaced their <object> within the vicinity.
One's <object> would seem to have absconded one's person.

#Intro3
Mayhaps a fine person such as yourself will assist me in locating it?
One humbly requests you peruse your stores of misplaced nick-nacks with the hope of locating it.

#OutroPositive1
Fabulous news my fine fellow. One is most greatful for your thorough service.
Terrific news, old pal. One was beginning to think it would remain absent from my person. 

#OutroPositive2
Cheerio old chum.
Toodlepip.

#OutroNegative1
Surely you jest? One would never allow such an object to grace one's possession.
Perhaps you are engaging in lark? One is not amused, however.

#OutroNegative2
One will become angry forthwith.
Good day to you.

#OutroNoItem1
Alas. One had hoped dearly that my <object> was in your possession.
Disappointing news, certainly. One is certain that one's <object> is weeping, verily.

#OutroNoItem2
One will continue one's search forthwith.
One is greatful for your assistance nonetheless. Cheerio.

#Weight
The weight? One would estimate it is <weight>, indeed. 
#Size
One is perplexed by which scale you may be requesting, but if one must choose, one would say <size>.
#ColourPositive
One's item is <colour_1>. One believes they're <colour_2> that colour, too.
#ColourNegative
One would say that it indeed would be a perilous task to label one's item with a colour.
#FlammablePositive
One would dare say that it would prove itself incompatible with fire, yes.
#FlammableNegative
One's possession is expertly crafted and thus not subject to fire in the same way other items may be.
#LivingPositive
Indeed it is, my good fellow. What a terribly silly question to present.
#LivingNegative
Living? Nay, it would be far from an accurate description. Surely my good fellow is jesting?
#EdgesPositive
One's missing item is indeed graced with edges, as one would expect.
#EdgesNegative
There is nary an edge on the thing. Perhaps it is due to the fine craft on mine?
#DensityPositive
One's item would hide itself beneath the surface, were one to be careless enough to introduce it to water.
#DensityNegative
One's item is of such extravagance and fine craft that it would rise itself out of the water, bobbing around until one reclaimed it.
#Feel
One would say it is very <feel>, old pal. Perhaps the most <feel>, even.
#EdiblePositive
Should one get peckish, it could indeed serve to satiate oneself for a moment. Indeed.
#EdibleNegative
One has not heard of items such as mine being an edible meal, nay. 
#Value
Despite one's appearance, my item is fairly <value>. Exceedingly prudent for someone of one's stature, certainly.
#Temperature
One has not measured with the appropriate apparatus, but one would estimate it is <temperature>.
#RecyclablePositive
Given the quality of the materials with which one's item is crafted, it would be trivial to recycle it efficiently.
#RecyclableNegative
Nay, one would like to ensure you are aware that one paid good money to ensure it was as unrecyclable as possible.
#Mouthfeel
A person of my stature? Engage in mouthfeel? Surely you jest? One's item has <mouthfeel> mouthfeel, but surely you jest?
#BlendPositive
It would be but a trivial task for a blender worthy of one's ownership to make short work of even my prized possession.
#BlendNegative
One's possession would never find its way into the jaws of said blender. But if that were to be the case, one's possession would be the victor.
#Shape
Verily, one would agree that it is <shape>-shaped. Verily.
#CustomsPositive
While an ordinary officer may find a problem with said item, one is not ordinary and thus does not have to deal with said officer.
#CustomsNegative
Nay, one's item would not prove to be a hinderance in such a scenario, unless it is recognised and fawned over for its inherent beauty. 
#MagneticPositive
One's possession attracts both persons and magnets, indeed.
#MagneticNegative
One's possession is of such worth that it has likely decided to reject the likes of the simple magnet, in favour of persons such as oneself.
