Yo! Is this the Lost and Found, yo?
Hey there, yo! You the boss, yo?

I lost my <object>, yo. Not cool.
I was looking over there, yo. Then my <object>, it went missing on me, yo. 
I'm missing my <object>, yo. You happen to have seen it, yo?

Lend us a hand, yo!
Help us out, yo!
Thats it. Yo!

That's totally it, yo! I can't believe you found it, yo!
My <object>, yo! I'm over the moon, yo!

I won't forget this, yo! You're a legend, yo!
Thanks so much, yo! Abayo!

#OutroNegative1
Yo. This isn't even close, yo.
You kidding, yo? Am I a joke to you, yo?

#OutroNegative2
Did you just guess, yo? Forget it, yo.
Not cool at all, yo. 

#OutroNoItem1
No way, yo. I thought for sure it'd be here, yo.
Aww, yo. I'd bet all my remaining time that it'd be here, yo.

Thanks for checking anyway, yo.
Please keep an eye out for me, yo.

Got an edge here and an edge there, yo. Pretty edgy, yo.

Dense as heck, yo. A real sinker even, yo.
